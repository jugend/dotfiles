#
# The `thefuck` command is a tool that automatically corrects errors in previous terminal commands. It works by analyzing the last command you ran, identifying potential mistakes, and suggesting or executing a corrected version of the command.
#
# For example:
# ```bash
# $ git comit -m "fix typo"
# git: 'comit' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
#
# $ fuck
# git commit -m "fix typo"
# eval "$(thefuck --alias)"
