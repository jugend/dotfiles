## npm publish

If you haven't already set your NPM author info, now you should:

npm set init.author.name "Your Name"
npm set init.author.email "you@example.com"
npm set init.author.url "http://yourblog.com"

npm adduser
Then create a package.json and publish it:

cd /path/to/your-project
npm init

npm install -g pakmanager

# this shows you dependencies as you `require`d them
pakmanager deps

# now edit `package.json` and add any deps you forgot about
npm publish ./


# Beta and Release versions

If you don't want something to install by default

npm publish ./ --tag beta


# If you published a bugfix as v1.0.7 and need to set v1.1.3 back to latest

git checkout v1.0.7
npm publish ./

git checkout v1.1.3
npm tag foobar@1.1.3 latest
